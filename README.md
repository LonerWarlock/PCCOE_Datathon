# Cheating Detection in Online Gaming

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect cheating behavior in online gaming environments. Cheating is a persistent issue that affects fair play, and our solution aims to assist game developers by providing an effective classification model to identify cheaters using system attributes, player behavior patterns, and security configurations.

## Objective
The primary objective is to create a robust and accurate model capable of distinguishing between legitimate players and suspected cheaters. By leveraging the dataset, which includes various technical and behavioral features, this project will contribute to enhancing game security.

## Approach
To achieve the project goals, the following steps will be undertaken:
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Analyze the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features for cheating detection.
3. **Model Training**: Train multiple classification models to determine the most effective approach.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and optimize for accuracy.
5. **Deployment**: Provide a scalable solution that can be integrated into gaming systems for real-time or batch analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of anonymized gaming session data with the following categories:

- **General Identifiers:** Player information like IDs, versions, and anti-cheat configurations.
- **Player & Location Attributes:** Geographic and regional player data.
- **System Information:** Details about the gaming platform, CPU, OS, and hardware.
- **Security & Protection:** Information on security tools, anti-cheat protection, and firewall status.
- **Hardware Attributes:** Device characteristics including CPU cores, RAM size, and screen resolution.
- **Operating System & Update Info:** OS version, license type, and update settings.
- **License & Genuine Check:** Game license status and testing flags.
- **Firmware & Boot Security:** Details like Secure Boot, BIOS information, and VM status.
- **Player & Region Data:** Gaming device flag, player region, and the target variable (**CheatingFlag**).

## Key Challenges
- **Class Imbalance:** The number of cheaters is expected to be significantly lower than legitimate players.
- **Noisy Features:** Some system attributes may introduce noise rather than contribute to accurate detection.
- **Obfuscated Data:** Feature names have been anonymized, requiring additional exploration for meaningful insights.

## Evaluation Metric
- The performance of models will be evaluated using **Accuracy** as the primary metric.

## Results and Insights
Upon completion, detailed analysis reports and model performance metrics will be shared. Insights from the project will provide valuable understanding for enhancing gaming security measures.
